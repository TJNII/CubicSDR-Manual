Tuning in NOAA stations
-----------------------

There are a few quick ways to tell if your setup is working properly. 
Nothing beats getting some useful weather data while you're at it.  To get
started, head over to http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/coverage/station_listing.html
and find your local weather station frequency.

To get started, find your "Modulation Selector" in the upper
left side of the display.  NOAA broadcasts in Narrow Band FM or NBFM, so go
ahead and select that.

In the Tuning Bar, enter your nearest NOAA station.  For me, that is
162.425.155 and your's will be in that neighborhood too.

Of course, make sure your device is started/stopped.
